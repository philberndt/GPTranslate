| ------------------------------ | --------------- | ---------------- | --------------------- |
| **gpt-4.1-nano** (recommended) | $0.10/1M tokens | $0.40/1M tokens  | **~$0.00005**         |

#### Azure Models and Prices

Azure OpenAI offers comparable pricing, which you can check in detail on the [official Azure AI Foundry pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/ai-foundry/). The `gpt-4.1-nano` model is a great choice due to its balance of low cost and high quality. You might also consider using the `model-router`, which automatically picks the most suitable model for your request. However, keep in mind that it won't always choose the cheapest option. For translation tasks specifically, specialised models like `mistral-small` or `mistral-small-2503` are worth exploring, as they are likely to deliver exceptional results.

### Real-World Usage Examples

#### With Ollama (Free¬π)

- **Any amount of translation**: $0.00 forever
- **No limits**: Translate entire books, documents, websites
- **Private & secure**: Perfect for sensitive content

#### With Cloud APIs

- **Single paragraph**: Less than $0.0001 with gpt-4.1-nano
- **100 translations/day**: ~$0.005 ($1.50/month)
- **1000 translations/day**: ~$0.05 ($15/month)
